# Hi, I'm Garam Kim

I'm a full-stack developer passionate about crafting intuitive user interfaces and building scalable backend solutions.  
I care deeply about design, performance, and the emotions that software can evoke.  
Currently exploring Three.js and creative 3D interfaces.
Previously, I released [bookit](https://github.com/iizz/bookit),  
a minimal reading log app designed to help users capture both memory and emotion through photo notes and keyword tagging.
